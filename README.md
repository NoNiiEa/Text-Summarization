# Text Summarization Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on text summarization by analyzing a dataset of tweets and generating a ranked summary of significant keywords or phrases. The project leverages techniques such as **Tri-Gram Graph Generation**, **PageRank**, and **TrustRank** to identify and score important nodes (words/phrases) in the graph.

The overall workflow includes:
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and process raw text data.
2. **Graph Generation**: Build a tri-gram graph where nodes represent n-grams (sequences of words).
3. **Ranking Nodes**: Use algorithms like PageRank and TrustRank to rank nodes based on importance.
4. **Summarization**: Extract and rank significant keywords/phrases for summarization.
